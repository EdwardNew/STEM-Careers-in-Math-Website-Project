  <h3>Our Mission:</h3>
  <p>Our mission is to educate others who may be seeking a math career by showing them the wide variety of jobs, as well as information about them. This includes whether or not the job is in a stable position (not at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence), as well as its salary, job trend, requirements, and a brief description of what the job does. We hope to give every aspiring math career a good idea of the many jobs available, and perhaps introduce them to one that they find appealing.</p>
    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>Our vision is that someday every person with a passion for mathematics will go on to pursue a career in what they love. We hope that through educating people about the wide variety of math professions and their attributes, we will allow them to make an educated decision about what they would like to do to follow their dream. We intend to have this website be the first step for a mathematician to choose the career that best fits their interests and lifestyle.</p>
